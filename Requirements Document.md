Battery Failure Visualization – Requirements Document

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for the Battery Failure Visualization project. Its overarching goal is to provide a platform for monitoring and analyzing battery data, detecting anomalies or failures, and visualizing relevant insights to improve battery reliability and maintenance processes.

1.2 Scope

The system encompasses:
	1.	A Database component responsible for storing and retrieving battery data.
	2.	A Backend logic layer that processes raw data, handles queries, and orchestrates data flows.
	3.	A Visualization or Frontend (not fully detailed in the provided snippet, but included here for completeness) that displays battery metrics, statuses, and alerts in a user-friendly interface.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
	•	Database: Manages persistence of battery data.
	•	Backend: The server-side application that connects to the database, processes data, and delivers functionality to end users (via an API or direct integration).
	•	Visualization: The user interface (potentially a web UI) for presenting battery data and analytics.
	•	Battery Failure: Any abnormal condition that leads to reduced capacity, malfunction, or hazardous operation state in a battery.

1.4 References
	•	Pytest documentation for unit and integration testing.
	•	Unittest.mock documentation for mocking and patching functionalities.

2. Overall Description

2.1 Product Perspective

The project is part of a battery analysis system. It depends on:
	•	Database for storing historical and real-time data.
	•	Backend modules that orchestrate ingestion, insertion, querying, and analysis.
	•	Visual Interface for stakeholders (e.g., engineers, technicians) to view battery health and failure predictions.

2.2 Product Functions

The key functionalities include:
	1.	Connect to Database: Securely establish a connection for read/write operations.
	2.	Insert Data: Ingest battery-related data (voltages, currents, temperatures, timestamps) or metadata into the system.
	3.	Query Data: Retrieve battery metrics and status details for display or further processing.
	4.	Disconnect: Safely close database connections to free resources.
	5.	Error Handling: Graceful handling of exceptions such as connection failures or insertion/query errors.
	6.	Visualization (future or separate module): Present data in charts, tables, or alerts for battery conditions.

2.3 User Characteristics
	•	Engineers/Developers working on battery health data.
	•	Technicians/Operators needing real-time or historical view of battery performance.
	•	Data Scientists/Analysts requiring in-depth data queries and analyses for predictive maintenance.

2.4 Constraints
	•	Must operate under the performance constraints typical of databases (e.g., sub-second read and write operations for real-time data).
	•	Resource constraints vary by environment (e.g., on-site server vs. cloud-based).
	•	Security constraints may require secure authentication/authorization (beyond the scope of these code snippets, but part of overall system design).

2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
	•	The database engine (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) is assumed to be supported or configured.
	•	Python environment with pytest for testing and unittest.mock for mocking interfaces.
	•	Future expansions may include integrations with external battery data providers or advanced analytics pipelines.

3. Functional Requirements

This section details the project’s individual functions. Each requirement is written as FR-#.

3.1 Database Connection

FR-1: The system shall be able to establish a connection to the underlying database.
	•	Description: The Database.connect() method is expected to return a boolean indicating success (e.g., True if the connection is established).
	•	Priority: High
	•	Test:
	•	The unit test test_database_connection checks that connect() returns True.
	•	It also verifies connect() is called only once.

3.2 Insert Data

FR-2: The system shall provide a way to insert data into the database.
	•	Description: The Database.insert(data) method receives some form of battery data or metadata and stores it. It returns an integer or similar identifier (e.g., a new row ID).
	•	Priority: High
	•	Test:
	•	The unit test test_database_insert ensures insert() returns the expected value (e.g., 42 in the mock).
	•	It also verifies insert() is called with the correct argument.

3.3 Query Data

FR-3: The system shall retrieve data from the database based on user queries or filters.
	•	Description: The Database.query(query_string) method returns a list of dictionaries (or similar structure) containing the requested rows.
	•	Priority: High
	•	Test:
	•	The unit test test_database_query verifies query() returns the expected list of dictionaries.
	•	It also checks the query method is called with the correct argument.

3.4 Disconnect

FR-4: The system shall allow safe termination of the database connection.
	•	Description: The Database.disconnect() method properly closes any open connections and returns a boolean (True upon success).
	•	Priority: Medium
	•	Test:
	•	The unit test test_database_disconnect checks the method returns True.
	•	It also verifies that the method is called once.

3.5 Handle Connection Failures

FR-5: The system shall handle exceptions when the database connection fails.
	•	Description: If the underlying database connection cannot be established, Database.connect() should raise an exception with an appropriate error message.
	•	Priority: High
	•	Test:
	•	The unit test test_database_connection_failure mocks an exception (Exception("Connection failed")) and asserts that the system raises it.

3.6 Handle Insert Failures

FR-6: The system shall handle exceptions when data insertion fails.
	•	Description: If insertion is unsuccessful, Database.insert() should raise an exception with an informative message.
	•	Priority: High
	•	Test:
	•	The unit test test_database_insert_failure mocks an exception (Exception("Insert failed")) and checks that it is raised.

3.7 Visualization (Planned / Future)

FR-7: The system should provide real-time or near-real-time visualizations of battery data and anomalies.
	•	Description: The data retrieved via Database.query() would populate charts, dashboards, or alerts to help monitor battery health. (Implementation is not in the provided snippet but is inferred from project goals.)
	•	Priority: Medium
	•	Test:
	•	Integration and UI tests (future) would confirm that correct data is displayed in the frontend.

4. Non-Functional Requirements

4.1 Performance
	•	NFR-1: Database operations should complete within acceptable time (e.g., under 100ms for typical queries, subject to network and data volume constraints).
	•	NFR-2: The system should scale to handle large volumes of battery data, especially in production environments.

4.2 Reliability
	•	NFR-3: System shall withstand intermittent connectivity issues; partial failures should not bring the entire system down.

4.3 Maintainability
	•	NFR-4: Code shall follow consistent style and be covered by unit tests (e.g., the tests in test_database.py).
	•	NFR-5: Database schemas and APIs should be documented for easier future updates.

4.4 Usability (Future Visualization)
	•	NFR-6: The visualization component should have an intuitive interface with clear labeling, real-time charts (where applicable), and a responsive design.

4.5 Security
	•	NFR-7: Access to battery data should be restricted to authorized users.
	•	NFR-8: The system should implement secure protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) for data in transit.
(This is out of scope of the snippet but essential in production.)

5. System Architecture Overview

A high-level view:
	1.	Frontend (Visualization) – A possible web UI or other display layer for real-time or historical battery data.
	2.	Backend – Python-based logic that receives requests, processes data, interacts with the database, and runs analytics if needed.
	3.	Database – Persists battery data (tables for raw measurements, error logs, historical records).

⸻

6. Testing and Validation
	•	Unit Tests: Already exemplified in test_database.py using pytest. Focus on each method in the Database class.
	•	Integration Tests: To ensure the entire workflow from data ingestion to visualization works as intended.
	•	End-to-End Tests: (Planned) Simulate real-world usage, including storing sample battery readings and generating visual reports.

7. Deployment Considerations
	•	Configuration: The database connection details, environment variables, etc., must be easily configurable for different environments (development, staging, production).
	•	Logging and Monitoring: The system should log significant events (connections, errors) and be monitored for real-time operational status.
	•	CI/CD: Automated pipelines can run the test suite (pytest) before deploying updates to ensure stability.
